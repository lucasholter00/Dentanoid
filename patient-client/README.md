# Patient Client
Welcome to the Patient Client! This Client is intended to be used by users that are patients, and that will search, book and/or cancel appointments.

## Getting started

This client is written in NodeJS. [Check this link for more information about NodeJS.](https://nodejs.org/en).

To run this client you need to follow the steps described below:

### Installing NodeJS using BREW (if you dont have NodeJS)

If you do not have NodeJS installed on your computer you can download both brew and NodeJS with these commands:

#### Install brew
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
``````

If this command does not work, [check here](https://brew.sh/).

#### Install NodeJS with brew
```
brew install node
``````


### Run Patient API
In order to build and run the Patient client you need to type these commands in to your terminal:


```
npm install // run this command if you have not already installed npm

npm run serve
```
Congratulations! You are now running the Patient client.
